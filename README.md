## Scraping
I used the requests library to scrape through and get data from a website. Made use of selenium for pages that did not fully load data due to JavaScript code. <be >
Then make use of the BeautifulSoup library to convert the HTML to data that can be stored in a data frame (using pandas)

## Cleaning
Cleaning up the data set by removing any unwanted columns, removing some characters and replacing NaN with 0s. <be >
All three tables were combined and cleaned using different key values for merging. Added some small visualisations to see trends.
